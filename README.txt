## Getting Started

To run this project, you'll first have to install the Dart SDK on your computer followed by the flutter SDk. 
Once done you have to run flutter doctor to ensure you have all the flutter configs right on your machine.

On completion, install an IDE that's compatible with flutter and dart e.g. VS Code or Android Studio, most preferably 
Android Studio. Install the Dart and Flutter plugins for these IDEs from their respective market places.

Make sure to install Android SDKs if you plan to run the project on an android device, or to install google chrome or microsoft edge 
in order to run it as a web application.

Once the above steps are complete:
### ON Android
To run this project on android, you'll have to connect a physical device or wifi or usb cable with android debugging
turned on on the phone. You can also opt for using a virtual device that can be created using Android Studio's 
device manager.

After connecting, the IDE will identify the device and display it on the list of devices the project can be run on.
Once you click on the debug or run option of the IDE, the project will be built and installed onto the device.
The project only supports devices with android version 6 and above.

Once this is done, the IDE will automatically detect its presence and list it as an option for debugging.

On selecting run or debug in the IDE, the project will be launched in a new tab and you'll be able to view the app.
